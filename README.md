# WebScraperNFL
The purpose of this program is to assist NFL Fantasy Drafters with their draft by providing the best players at every position based on fantasy points. This would allow the user to based their choice for any position that matters (QB, RB, WR, TE) and for any year. This shows the user the important players and their consistency over the years.

One of the features I developed are the buttons that allow the user to use a drop down menu and then select the select year button to choose a new year to search for. Another feature is the instruction label at the bottom that assists the user with how the navigate the program. I also allow the user to choose to select any position they want and it display the top 10 players at that position for that year by scraping the web.
